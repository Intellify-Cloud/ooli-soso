    title: "About Us"
    text2: "At oobalink Northern Suburbs our vision is to enable positive futures for our clients. Our mission is to be our client’s most trusted partner. Our passionate is in helping our clients achieve their goal of buying property. We are committed to providing the best service possible. <br>
    
    <br> 
    
    We are seasoned property professionals, and have spent the last 28 years in the property industry, gaining knowledge and experience in the different aspects of property sales and finance. I have a keen interest in communications, marketing, sales and customer service, obtained a National Diploma in Public  Relations, NQF4 and spent some time in the corporate world of Public Relations and Publicity.<br> 
    
    <br> 

    I have more than 15 years’ specialised experience in bond finance and origination, having worked at ABSA Home Loans, Sanlam Home Loans, Mortgage Max and BetterBond previously. I am committed to excellent client service, building long-term relationships and always focus on the client's best interests rather than my own personal gain. 
    
    On a personal note, I was born in Cape Town, matriculated at Alexander Road High School in PE, studied at the Nelson Mandela University (PE) and spent 5 years in Langebaan as an Estate Agent. I enjoy running, stand-up paddle boarding, scuba diving, open-water swimming, sailing and horse-riding. On weekends (when I’m not doing show houses with agents) I enjoy spending time with my brothers, Eldon and Warren, and father, Ernie. <br>    
    <br>

    I am proud to be associated with Evo, who is a part of the ooba Group. Evo was launched to the market as a licensee model designed to cater for the origination business market and individual home loan consultants seeking to align themselves with an established brand within the mortgage origination industry. evo is managed by a highly efficient team with years of experience in banking and origination business, with over 100 licensed independent offices."
